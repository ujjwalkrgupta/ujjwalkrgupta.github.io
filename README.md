## Welcome to my GitHub Page

### So, there goes my story....

``` 

It all began in the year 2000, when first personal computer came in our family and as every child has an inquisitive nature towards new things, mine was pure love for the computers.

I want to help the world in developing softwares , building new technologies and making it accessible to each and every individual.

My objective is to get the technical as well as the business know-hows of the IT industry , to use the gained knowledge and experience to overcome the modern problems and take the society a step closer towards pure Digitalization.

I am skilled and interested in areas like Java , C, C++, PHP, Python, mySQL,Android app development, web development, cloud computing, Big Data analytics, Internet of things.

Above mentions maybe very common knowledge among various developers today ,but what sets me apart from the rest is my passion towards learning and my never-ending appetite for knowledge and learning new technologies. That is what keeps me awake at night and give that butterfly feeling in the stomach.

One of the most important aspect of working in any organization is team work. I believe my experiences in working with people from various backgrounds in technical as well as non-technical field makes me a good team player.
